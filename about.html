                Building a website is, in many ways, an exercise of willpower. It’s tempting to get distracted by
                the
                bells
                and whistles of the design process, and forget all about creating compelling content.

                It's that compelling content that's crucial to making inbound marketing work for your business.

                So how do you balance your remarkable content creation with your web design needs? It all starts
                with
                the
                "About Us" page.

            <p>For a remarkable About page, all you need to do is figure out your company's unique identity, and
                then
                share
                it with the world. Easy, right? Of course not. Your "About Us" page is one of the most important
                pages
                on
                your website, and it needs to be well crafted. This profile also happens to be one of the most
                commonly
                overlooked pages, which is why you should make it stand out.

                The good news? It can be done. In fact, there are some companies out there with remarkable "About
                Us"
                pages,
                the elements of which you can emulate on your own website.
